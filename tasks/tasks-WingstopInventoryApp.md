### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npm test` or `yarn test` to run frontend tests. Use `pytest` to run backend tests.
- Backend API documentation will be automatically generated by FastAPI at `/docs` endpoint.
